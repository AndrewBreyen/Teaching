| 6:00 pm | Anton Andrews | AI And Ethics|AI has impacted society and will continue to rapidly evolve over the years. Two impacts from the seemingly endless amounts of ways society can be affected are the benefits and disadvantages of AI. AIs are computer generated machines/technology, hence, they do not possess the capacity to process situations like us humans can, leading to many ethical questions. Since AI has become a part of our daily lives and can possibly become integrated into society on a larger scale, human ethics will become essential for them. Throughout this document I will delve into HCI and AI ethics detailing ethical risks and benefits, as well as possible questions raised regarding AI, backing it up with scholarly sources. At the end of the document, you will understand why it is vital to integrate ethics into AI, so as to reduce risks as much as possible. |
