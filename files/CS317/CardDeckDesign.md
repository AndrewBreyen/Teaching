## Virtual Deck of Cards Design

### Goal: Design a Card Deck class.

In preparation for our Solitaire Simulator, we will need a PlayinCards class.  In this assignment, we will first use User Stories to determine what our deck of cards must provide.  Then we will design the class _before_ writing code. Then we will create the class.

### Assignment details:

- Create a set of user stories for the Card Deck class.
- Create a set of user stories for a design tool that you will select to help you design the Card Deck class.
- Select a design tool: There are several useful design tools available online.
- Develop a Card Deck design using your design tool.
- Your design should include a list of the major attributes and methods of the Card Deck class
