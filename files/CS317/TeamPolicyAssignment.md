## Team Policy and Checklists
Teams function better with a common understanding of expectations and processes.  A team policy and a set of checklists for common processes help _a lot_ to make sure everyone is being a good team member

In this assignment, each team will define its community policy and develop a set of checklists for:
- On-ramping a new team member
- Preparing for a team member's departure

The [A-Team Tools repository](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/A-Team-Tools/) provides guidance and examples for creating policies and checklists.

### In class assignment

**Starting with an empty Google Doc file, create a draft team policy**
- You may use the following example policy as a starting point for ideas
- Every policy you create should be agreed upon by your team members
- Focus on positive statements
- Be descriptive more than prescriptive


### Sample Team Policy

#### Collegeville Research Team Policies

The following policies are meant to guide team members in their activities, establishing expectations for ongoing work.

1. Team members will conduct themselves in a professional manner, observing institutional policies given to them at student and faculty orientation.
1. Initiation, transition and exit events will be guided by creating and following an event checklist.
1. All work will be tracked in the organization issues-only repository [Labora](https://github.com/Collegeville/Labora).
1. All work, notes and relevant content will be kept in a repository associated with the team GitHub organization.  
1. Each team member will have an individual Collegeville repository: Lastname-Firstname-Work.  This repo contains:
    1. Thesis or dissertation, as appropriate.
    1. Annotated bibliography of resources.
    1. Personal notes from project meetings and research activities.
1. If work is appropriate for one of the team repos, it will be retain there.  Otherwise, it is kept in the team member's individual repo.
1. Team members will update project Kanban board prior to team meetings, more frequently if particularly active.
1. Exceptions to these policies are acceptable, but:
    1. Important exceptions should be approved before acting.
    1. Other exceptions should mentioned at next team meeting or before.
    1. Exceptions should be infrequent. 
    1. If an exception is frequent, actions or policies should be updated.
1. Any concerns not addressed by team policies should be discussed with Dr. Heroux.

### After class assignment

Using the examples from the [A-Team Tools repository](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/A-Team-Tools/):
- Create an issues-only repository in your team's GitHub organization
- Put your community policies document in the repo
- Put in a master initiation and exit checklist in the repo
