## Virtual Deck of Cards Implementation

### Goal: Implement a Card Deck class.

In preparation for our Solitaire Simulator, we will need a PlayinCards class.  In this assignment, we will implement the class you designed.

### Assignment details:

- Create a Card Deck class using Python.
- Create tests for the class.
- Confirm that the class works.

### Resources:
- [Overview of the game of solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)).
- [The Fisher-Yates (Knuth version) Algorithm:](https://exceptionnotfound.net/understanding-the-fisher-yates-card-shuffling-algorithm) Use this algorithm to implement card shuffling algorithm.
